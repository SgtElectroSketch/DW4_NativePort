# Dragon Warrior IV Decompilation Journal

## Purpose And Ground Rules

This file is the historical engineering record for a from-scratch decompilation of the verified reference image. It records reproducible observations, decisions, commands, assumptions, discrepancies, and validation results. Current metrics are maintained in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md); this journal is not a second status source.

The project obeys these constraints:

1. No public decompilation source is used.
2. No code, labels, build files, or architectural conclusions are copied from an existing decompilation.
3. The verified reference ROM and direct runtime/static observations are the game-specific evidence base.
4. Third-party tools must be pinned, provenance-documented, or resolved through portable environment configuration.
5. The project is Windows-native and opens in Visual Studio 2026.
6. Every accepted source change must continue to build a structurally valid ROM. Baseline changes must also retain the exact reference SHA-256.
7. Uncertain names are marked as candidates or unknowns instead of being presented as fact.

An earlier web reconnaissance result was discarded when the no-public-decomp constraint was stated. No content or conclusions from it are present in this project. Accepted game-specific labels are traceable to reviewed configuration, direct ROM inspection, or runtime evidence.

## Environment Inventory

Verified local build environment on 2026-09-19:

- Visual Studio 2026 Community
- Visual Studio version reported by the installer: `18.10.12201.205`
- MSBuild discovered through `vswhere`
- MSVC compiler family: 19.x from toolset directory `VC\Tools\MSVC\14.51.36231`
- Visual C++ Platform Toolset: `v145`
- Installed .NET SDKs: `9.0.317` and `10.0.401`
- Windows 10 SDK include and library roots are installed.

Visual Studio 2026 is version 18. The solution header therefore identifies Visual Studio version 18 and each C++ project selects `v145` explicitly.

## Supplied Inputs

### ROM

The source ROM was inspected directly, without modifying or copying it into the repository.

- File: exact reference ROM supplied outside the repository
- File length: 524,304 bytes (`0x80010`)
- SHA-256: `373BE958CB33651FE599A6B282D2A232EB3B99559C258B2C70B53DF0FA31E34A`
- SHA-1: `993A171A99D29805D6634CF40190DE138B4A99B9`
- MD5: `33690B361265C840FDA965418ADF3143`

The 16 header bytes are:

```text
4E 45 53 1A 20 00 12 08 00 00 70 07 00 00 00 01
```

Decoded header facts:

- Signature: `NES` followed by `0x1A`
- Format: NES 2.0, selected by byte 7 bits 2-3 equal to binary `10`
- PRG count: header byte 4 is `0x20`, meaning 32 units of 16 KiB
- PRG size: 32 * 16,384 = 524,288 bytes
- CHR count: header byte 5 is zero, so there is no CHR ROM
- Mapper: 1
- Submapper: 0
- Battery-backed memory flag: set
- Trainer flag: clear
- Header mirroring bit: clear, conventionally decoded as horizontal
- PRG RAM: none declared
- PRG NVRAM: 8 KiB
- CHR RAM: 8 KiB
- CHR NVRAM: none declared
- Timing: NTSC

The complete size equation is:

```text
16-byte header + (32 * 16,384-byte PRG banks) + 0-byte CHR ROM = 524,304 bytes
```

The final six PRG bytes are:

```text
02 05 D8 FF 08 C4
```

Interpreted as little-endian 6502 vectors:

- NMI: `$0502`
- RESET: `$FFD8`
- IRQ/BRK: `$C408`

The NMI target is in internal RAM. Later reset analysis proved that startup writes a `JMP $C15A` trampoline at
`$0502`; the byte-level proof is retained under "First Static Code Pass" below.

### Offline Reference Material

The user supplied saved HTML pages under `Resources`. They are reference notes, not an existing source-code decompilation. The current set includes:

- a general game page
- ROM map
- RAM map
- SRAM map
- map format
- map list
- text table
- tile behaviors
- values
- RetroAchievements code notes

The references are useful but not treated as authoritative when they disagree with the ROM. A confirmed example is mirroring: the saved general page says vertical mirroring, while byte 6 of the actual ROM header is `0x12`, whose low bit is clear. The project preserves the exact header bytes and records the discrepancy rather than silently choosing the prose value.

The supplied page's known-dump table gives the US ROM MD5 `e45105e8f82d8aa29b39260fd531498d` and SHA-1 `f4759104bd0241ce3c038209446aeda79f170fdd`. Those differ from the complete input file because this input carries a populated NES 2.0 header. An in-memory test replaced only header bytes 7-15 with zeroes, leaving all PRG bytes untouched. The resulting complete-file hashes exactly matched both supplied known-dump values. Therefore the project ROM has the same US PRG payload as the documented dump; its header metadata is the only difference relevant to those hashes.

At the initial discovery checkpoint, the supplied ROM map documented only selected banks and regions:

- Bank `$08`: tileset tables and tile definitions
- Banks `$09-$0B`: compressed map data and overworld data
- Banks `$0C-$0E`: graphics, palette data, and two identified code regions
- Bank `$0F`: a map-bank selection routine identified by headerless file address `$3E9AD`
- Bank `$17`: map information pointer and metadata tables

The initial labels seeded in `config\labels.tsv` were limited to these explicit observations. Later static/runtime
evidence and all-body audits replaced that seed vocabulary with the complete curated inventory tracked today.

The saved RetroAchievements page states that its address values use an emulator memory layout. The low addresses used for initial RAM symbols correspond directly to CPU RAM or cartridge WRAM. These descriptions are third-party observations and must be validated against instruction references before being upgraded from provisional documentation.

## Mapper And Address Model

The cartridge uses MMC1 with 512 KiB PRG and CHR RAM. The PRG is divided into 32 physical 16 KiB banks numbered `$00-$1F`.

The corrected assembly model is:

- Physical banks `$00-$0E` and `$10-$1E` use logical CPU base `$8000`.
- Physical bank `$0F` is the fixed `$C000-$FFFF` bank for the lower 256 KiB outer region.
- Physical bank `$1F` is the fixed `$C000-$FFFF` bank for the upper 256 KiB outer region.
- The ROM file offset for a physical bank is `0x10 + bank * 0x4000`.
- For switchable banks, CPU address is `$8000 + offsetWithinBank`.
- For fixed banks `$0F` and `$1F`, CPU address is `$C000 + offsetWithinBank`.

The first model treated only bank `$1F` as fixed. A raw scan for calls to the fixed-bank trampoline table exposed matching call sites at identical offsets in banks `$0F` and `$1F`. Direct comparison then showed:

- banks `$0F` and `$1F` have identical NMI, RESET, and IRQ vectors
- 9,732 of 16,384 bytes are equal at identical offsets
- call sites at offsets `$01AD`, `$09FF`, `$0DD5`, `$0E4D`, `$0EA6`, `$1569`, and `$157C` contain identical instructions

This is consistent with a 512 KiB SUROM-style board where a CHR-register bit chooses the outer 256 KiB PRG region and the last 16 KiB bank of each region is fixed. The source model was corrected before expanding lower-half analysis.

The supplied ROM-map statement "Bank 0F, Address 3E9AD" uses a headerless linear ROM address. The calculation is `$0F * $4000 + $29AD = $3E9AD`; with physical bank `$0F` mapped at `$C000`, the CPU address is `$E9AD`, not `$A9AD`. The label and code seed were corrected accordingly.

The supplied ROM map writes headerless file offsets such as `$20000` for bank `$08`. This matches `8 * 0x4000`. The actual `.nes` file offset is 16 bytes later because of the iNES header.

## Toolchain Decision

The local NES assembler inventory included upstream asm6f. It was selected because:

1. It is specifically intended for NES/Famicom 6502 assembly.
2. It supports bank-oriented `BASE`, source inclusion, raw byte directives, symbols, listings, and emulator label output.
3. Its license permits use, modification, and redistribution.
4. Its source is a single C file, making it practical to vendor and build directly with Visual Studio 2026.
5. A source-built local copy avoids requiring an unrelated package manager or Unix compatibility layer.

The following files were copied from the supplied local tool directory:

- `tools\asm6f\asm6f.c`
- `tools\asm6f\LICENSE.txt`

Before modification, the copies were verified byte-identical:

- `asm6f.c`: 74,197 bytes, SHA-256 `9F6F68DCA53AB60B6C748DCE306E4DA67C2DD9880F4CF8CF5F9E41602465B2F0`
- `LICENSE.txt`: 111 bytes, SHA-256 `EB03F4830F4275217A38696495E9394BDC43D7047A00B9456ADC54F2EA66AA38`

An unmodified MSVC C17 probe failed for two portability reasons:

- GNU named variadic macro syntax (`fmt, args...`)
- use of `PATH_MAX`, which MSVC does not define

The project-local source was changed only as follows:

- variadic macros were rewritten using standard C99/C17 `__VA_ARGS__`
- `PATH_MAX` is defined as 4096 only when compiling with MSVC and no prior definition exists
- the file header states that the source was locally modified, satisfying the tool's license requirement for altered versions

The patched source compiled with Visual Studio 2026 using `/std:c17 /W4 /O2`. The probe produced zero errors and the resulting executable printed `asm6f 1.6 (+ f003)`. Nine MSVC narrowing warnings remained in Debug at warning level 3. Each affected value was bounded by the assembler's existing address, buffer, or bank-size constraints, so the project-local source now uses explicit casts and a `size_t` string-length local. This records the intended legacy conversion while keeping Visual Studio builds warning-free.

## Project Architecture

`DragonWarrior4.sln` contains three projects:

1. `asm6f`: a C console application built by MSVC `v145`.
2. `Dw4Tool`: a .NET 10 console application that validates the ROM and produces deterministic bank assembly.
3. `DragonWarrior4`: a C++ utility project that assembles and verifies the game ROM after its tool dependencies build.

The ROM build has no dependency on the original `.nes` file. The original ROM is required only to regenerate the checked-in bank source files.

`Dw4Tool extract` performs these checks before writing source:

1. exact total file size
2. exact 16-byte header
3. exact SHA-256 identity

It then emits one file per 16 KiB PRG bank. Every source row contains at most 16 explicit byte values and a CPU-address comment. A row is split early when necessary so a configured label lands on the exact byte it names. Output uses UTF-8 without a BOM and deterministic uppercase hexadecimal.

`Dw4Tool verify` checks structural fields. Adding `--exact` also requires the reference SHA-256. The Visual Studio ROM project uses exact verification for the baseline build.

## Why The Initial Source Uses Byte Directives

Separating code from data in a bank-switched 6502 ROM cannot be done correctly by linear decoding alone. Data bytes frequently form valid 6502 opcodes, indirect calls obscure targets, and mapper state determines which physical bank an `$8000-$BFFF` address refers to.

The initial source therefore represents every byte explicitly before converting regions to mnemonics. This provides four important invariants:

1. no byte is omitted
2. no data is accidentally decoded as code
3. every semantic edit can be tested against a known-good exact build
4. labels and boundaries can improve incrementally without destabilizing unrelated banks

This is a lossless disassembly baseline, not a claim that all routines have already been understood. A region is converted from `db` to instructions only after an entry point or execution trace supports that classification. Unknown data remains data.

## Validation Protocol

The baseline acceptance check is:

```text
SHA256(rebuilt ROM) == 373BE958CB33651FE599A6B282D2A232EB3B99559C258B2C70B53DF0FA31E34A
```

Additional structural checks are:

- output length is 524,304 bytes
- output header is exactly the 16 reference bytes
- output mapper decodes to 1
- output contains 524,288 PRG bytes and no CHR ROM bytes
- vectors remain NMI `$0502`, RESET `$FFD8`, IRQ/BRK `$C408`

The exact-hash test is deliberately stronger than testing in an emulator. FCEUX runtime tracing was added later
and now supplies the tracked execution/read/write evidence, but successful emulation still cannot prove byte
identity.

## Initial Semantic Plan

This was the original ordered plan. Its code discovery, classification, naming, and exact-build work is complete;
current completion state and remaining work live in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

The semantic work should proceed in this order:

1. Decode the fixed bank from RESET `$FFD8` and IRQ `$C408` by recursive control flow.
2. Verify whether startup copies code to RAM `$0502`, and identify the ROM source of that copy.
3. Identify MMC1 serial-write routines and determine the actual PRG banking mode.
4. Track constant bank selections into calls or jumps in `$8000-$BFFF`.
5. Convert only proven reachable instructions to mnemonics.
6. Use the supplied bank `$0E` code ranges as independent checks of code/data classification.
7. Use emulator coverage data to discover indirect and state-dependent entry points.
8. Name routines from observed effects and cross-references, keeping uncertain labels explicitly provisional.
9. Split verified structured data into tables using the supplied map, graphics, palette, and text-format notes.
10. Rebuild and exact-compare after each small conversion.

## Initial Questions And Resolution

These were the questions at the first checkpoint; they are retained to show how the evidence plan developed.

| Initial question | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Why is NMI vectored to RAM `$0502`? | Resolved: reset installs a `JMP $C15A` trampoline at `$0502`. |
| Which MMC1 mode is used? | Resolved for the source model through the fixed-bank writers at `$C118/$C12F/$C146` and runtime mapper tracing. |
| How is PRG bit 4 selected? | Resolved: `$FF91` propagates bit 4 through MMC1 CHR bank 0, matching SUROM outer-bank behavior. |
| Which banks hold code, graphics, maps, scripts, or text? | Resolved: all 32 dominant roles and every detailed byte are classified; see [BANK_MAP.md](BANK_MAP.md) and [STATUS.md](STATUS.md). |
| Which supplied RAM names are stable? | Resolved by policy: only names supported by decoded references or runtime evidence were curated; the third-party list was not imported wholesale. |
| Does the Japanese-targeted RetroAchievements note set align with the USA ROM? | Handled conservatively: individual observations were accepted only when the exact USA ROM independently confirmed them. |
| Which supplied ROM-map claims apply to the USA revision? | Handled per claim through exact-ROM bytes, consumers, and traces rather than assuming revision-wide authority. |

## Baseline Build Result - 2026-09-19

The first complete Visual Studio 2026 `Release|x64` build succeeded through `build.cmd`.

- MSBuild version: 18.10.1
- Build errors: 0
- Initial inherited C compiler warnings from asm6f: 9 conversion warnings
- Assembled output size: 524,304 bytes
- Assembled output SHA-256: `373BE958CB33651FE599A6B282D2A232EB3B99559C258B2C70B53DF0FA31E34A`
- Exact reference match: yes

This proves that the 16-byte header, all 32 PRG banks, ordering, and bank sizes in the generated source match the supplied ROM exactly.

## First Static Code Pass - 2026-09-19

`Dw4Tool` now contains an official NMOS 6502 opcode table and a conservative recursive control-flow analyzer. Initial entry points come only from CPU vectors, direct ROM evidence, or code ranges explicitly identified by the supplied ROM map.

The analyzer follows:

- sequential fallthrough
- relative conditional branches
- direct `JSR` targets
- direct absolute `JMP` targets

The analyzer stops at:

- `RTS`
- `RTI`
- `BRK`
- indirect `JMP`
- unsupported opcodes
- an existing instruction operand
- a physical bank boundary
- an explicit supplied code-range boundary

For target resolution, `$C000-$FFFF` maps to physical bank `$1F`. A target in `$8000-$BFFF` maps to the current physical bank only when analysis is already inside a switchable bank. A fixed-bank call into `$8000-$BFFF` is not followed because the active MMC1 bank cannot be inferred from the address alone.

The first version lacked explicit range ends. It followed sequential execution from bank `$0E:$BAF7` into the documented data table at `$BB53` and eventually stopped at unsupported byte `$42` at `$BB61`. This was a useful failure: exact binary reproduction still passed, but semantic classification was wrong. `code-seeds.tsv` was extended with optional exclusive end addresses. The two supplied bank `$0E` ranges now stop at `$8091` and `$BB53` respectively.

After correcting the boundaries:

- `Dw4Tool` built with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- Static analysis emitted 52 instructions / 100 bytes in bank `$0E`.
- Static analysis emitted 18 instructions / 33 bytes in bank `$0F`.
- Static analysis emitted 460 instructions / 891 bytes in bank `$1F`.
- The analyzer reported no warnings.
- The assembled ROM remained 524,304 bytes.
- The assembled SHA-256 remained `373BE958CB33651FE599A6B282D2A232EB3B99559C258B2C70B53DF0FA31E34A`.

This demonstrates that the emitted mnemonics and addressing modes round-trip to the original bytes. It does not by itself prove every seed is semantically correct; the provenance of each seed remains part of the acceptance criteria.

## Reset And NMI Findings - 2026-09-19

The RESET vector points to `$FFD8`. The reset stub is:

```asm
Reset:
  sei
  inc $FFDF
  jmp $C03D
```

`$FFDF` contains `$80`. On MMC1, a write with bit 7 set resets the serial shift register. The read-modify-write behavior of `INC` therefore supplies an MMC1 reset write before execution continues at `$C03D`.

The startup path waits for two PPU vblank intervals, disables rendering, initializes MMC1 state, clears RAM pages, clears PPU memory, initializes the OAM shadow, and enters the main path at `$C968`. Names in `labels.tsv` distinguish directly observed behavior from routines that still need broader behavioral analysis.

The NMI vector does not point into ROM. It contains `$0502`, and reset constructs a RAM trampoline:

```text
$0502 <- $4C       ; JMP absolute opcode
$0503 <- [$C0D2]   ; $5A
$0504 <- [$C0D3]   ; $C1
```

The resulting instruction at RAM `$0502` is `JMP $C15A`. This proves that ROM address `$C15A` is the NMI handler body. `$C15A` was therefore added as a code seed based on direct byte-level evidence rather than a guessed linear decode.

Three five-write routines at `$C118`, `$C12F`, and `$C146` shift accumulator bits into addresses `$9FFF`, `$BFFF`, and `$DFFF`. These addresses fall in the MMC1 control, CHR bank 0, and CHR bank 1 register ranges respectively. `$FF91` writes the low four PRG bank bits through `$FFFF` and propagates input bit 4 into the saved CHR bank 0 value written through `$BFFF`; this is consistent with a 512 KiB MMC1 board using an outer PRG bank bit.

## Fixed-Bank Trampoline Discovery - 2026-09-19

Each fixed bank begins with byte `$FF` followed by twenty consecutive absolute `JMP` instructions at `$C001`, `$C004`, ..., `$C03A`. Each entry is exactly three bytes. The target routines form a family at `$E54B-$E66A`.

The target routines share this shape:

1. preserve processor flags
2. store the caller-provided accumulator value at WRAM `$07CA`
3. read a two-byte pointer embedded immediately after the routine
4. store that pointer at WRAM `$6CDC-$6CDD`
5. restore flags
6. transfer control through executable WRAM at `$6CAD`

This supports describing `$C001-$C03C` as a fixed-bank trampoline table. The exact purpose and calling convention of each entry still require analysis of the WRAM routine and callers, so the entries retain neutral numbered names.

All twenty entries were added as bounded three-byte seeds in each fixed physical bank. The analyzer follows each direct target but cannot accidentally continue from one trampoline entry into the next.

## Switchable-Bank Seed Scan - 2026-09-19

A bounded raw-byte scan searched all physical PRG banks for opcode `$20` (`JSR`) or `$4C` (`JMP`) followed by one of the twenty trampoline addresses. It found 50 byte-pattern matches. Fourteen were already-decoded calls in fixed banks `$0F` and `$1F`. The other 36 candidates were distributed as follows:

- bank `$07`: 1
- bank `$19`: 6
- bank `$1B`: 5
- bank `$1D`: 6
- bank `$1E`: 18

There were no candidates in the supplied-known map/graphics banks `$08-$0D` or map-information bank `$17`. That distribution is useful supporting evidence, but a byte-pattern match alone is not proof of code.

The sole bank `$07` match at `$9C7D` decoded as `JSR $C025` followed by implausible instructions and unsupported opcode `$A3`. Its surrounding bytes have dense graphics/data characteristics, so that seed was removed and the region remains `db` data.

An initial scan result incorrectly listed bank `$1D:$AD75`. Direct byte inspection showed `$AD75` is `C5 A2`, not `20 10 C0`. A corrected scanner that printed each three-byte slice found the actual sixth bank `$1D` match at `$B99B` (`20 01 C0`). The incorrect seed was removed and `$B99B` was added. This incident is why candidate addresses are validated against their exact byte triples before acceptance.

The 35 retained switchable-bank call sites are used as forward-only entry seeds. The analyzer does not guess backward to a routine boundary. This can leave the beginning of a routine as `db`, but it avoids asserting an unsupported entry point.

## Static Analyzer Corrections - 2026-09-19

Two impossible fallthroughs were found and corrected during iterative validation:

1. Bank `$0E` analysis originally continued beyond the supplied code end `$BB52` into the palette override table at `$BB53`. Explicit exclusive end bounds were added to supplied code ranges.
2. Fixed-bank code at `$ED8F` executes `LDA #$00 / BEQ $EDD8`; treating both branch outcomes as possible decoded the inline table at `$ED93` as code. The analyzer now tracks the zero result of immediate register loads through flag-neutral instructions.
3. Fixed-bank code at `$EFB5` loads immutable ROM byte `$83` from `$EFBD`, then executes `BNE $EFD0`. The analyzer now also derives the zero flag for direct, non-indexed ROM loads whose physical bank mapping is known.
4. Generated labels are emitted only for addresses that became valid instruction starts. This prevents a rejected overlapping path from leaving an undefined symbolic branch target.

The analyzer remains deliberately narrow. It does not claim general constant propagation, resolve indirect jumps, infer targets from arbitrary pointer tables, or determine a switchable target when fixed-bank code calls `$8000-$BFFF` without known mapper state.

## Symbolic Operand Pass - 2026-09-19

`Dw4Tool` reads constants from `src\constants\*.inc` and substitutes them into decoded address operands. It also resolves labels in the current switchable bank and in the correct fixed bank for the active 256 KiB outer region.

Immediate operands remain numeric. An early formatter revision rendered `CPX #$45` as `CPX #PlayerLocalY` because it did not distinguish an immediate value from a zero-page address; the formatter was corrected before acceptance.

Absolute instructions targeting addresses below `$0100` are emitted with asm6f's `a:` width override. This prevents the assembler from shortening a three-byte absolute instruction to a two-byte zero-page instruction when a symbolic address is introduced.

Examples of current symbolic output include:

```asm
lda PPUSTATUS
sta MMC1_PRG_END
jsr InitializeMmc1
lda Bank0E_PaletteOverrideMaps,x
cmp CurrentMapNumber
ldy CurrentSubmapNumber
```

## Initial NMI-Seed Coverage - 2026-09-19

After dual-fixed-bank correction and validated trampoline-call seeding, the static report contains:

| Physical bank | Instructions | Bytes emitted as instructions |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `$0E` | 52 | 100 |
| `$0F` | 3,476 | 7,001 |
| `$19` | 6 | 18 |
| `$1B` | 570 | 1,241 |
| `$1D` | 180 | 369 |
| `$1E` | 801 | 1,650 |
| `$1F` | 3,522 | 7,243 |
| **Total** | **8,607** | **17,622** |

The analyzer report has no warnings. A full Visual Studio 2026 `Release|x64` build completes with zero warnings and zero errors. Its output is 524,304 bytes with SHA-256 `373BE958CB33651FE599A6B282D2A232EB3B99559C258B2C70B53DF0FA31E34A`, an exact match to the supplied ROM.

## Reproduction Commands

The extraction and exact build used these commands from the project root:

```bat
build\Release\tools\dw4tool\Dw4Tool.exe extract "<reference-rom>" "<repository-root>"
build.cmd
```

The one-step Visual Studio build command inside `build.cmd` is:

```bat
build.cmd
```

The generated `analysis\code-report.txt` is the concise machine-produced record of seeds, coverage, and warnings. This journal is the human-readable decision record.

## Dual-Fixed-Bank And Trampoline Expansion Result - 2026-09-19

After correcting physical bank `$0F` to CPU base `$C000`, its supplied map-bank routine appears at `$E9AD`, as predicted by the headerless file-offset calculation. Static analysis then recovered 3,476 instructions / 7,001 bytes in lower fixed bank `$0F`.

Adding byte-verified trampoline call sites in switchable banks expanded the analysis again. The accepted coverage
at this checkpoint was:

| Physical bank | Instructions | Bytes emitted as instructions |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `$0E` | 52 | 100 |
| `$0F` | 3,476 | 7,001 |
| `$19` | 6 | 18 |
| `$1B` | 570 | 1,241 |
| `$1D` | 180 | 369 |
| `$1E` | 801 | 1,650 |
| `$1F` | 3,522 | 7,243 |
| **Total** | **8,607** | **17,622** |

The generated report contains no warnings after false-positive removal. The Visual Studio 2026 Release build completes with zero warnings and zero errors and still produces the exact reference SHA-256.

## Command-Wrapper Validation - 2026-09-19

Both user-facing command wrappers were tested from the repository parent, not from the project directory. This verifies that they do not silently depend on the caller's current working directory.

The first external invocation of `extract.cmd` exposed a Windows argument-quoting edge case. `%~dp0` ends in a backslash; passing it directly as a quoted argument caused the .NET command-line parser to receive a trailing quote as part of the path. The script now passes `%~dp0.`, which denotes the same directory without a backslash immediately before the closing quote.

The corrected end-to-end results were:

- `extract.cmd` exit code: 0
- PRG bank source files regenerated: 32
- extraction warnings/errors: none
- `build.cmd` exit code: 0
- Visual Studio build warnings/errors: 0/0
- output path: `build\Release\Dragon Warrior IV (USA).nes`

## Tool-Driven Assembly Conversion - 2026-09-20

The earlier source generator contained its own small recursive decoder. That was useful for establishing a safe baseline, but the project now delegates assembly rendering to the mature local `da65` disassembler from cc65.

### da65

The pinned `third_party\cc65` submodule builds locally with Visual Studio 2026, Release x64, and `PlatformToolset=v145`. The resulting executable reports `da65 V2.19`.

- generated executable: ignored `tools\da65\da65.exe`
- source and license: pinned in `third_party\cc65`

`Dw4Tool extract` now performs these steps for every physical PRG bank:

1. writes the 16 KiB bank to ignored `work\da65`
2. converts validated instruction coverage into contiguous da65 `Code` and `ByteTable` ranges
3. exports curated RAM, hardware, table, and routine labels to the da65 info file
4. runs the project-local da65 executable
5. mechanically adapts ca65 directives to asm6f syntax
6. preserves zero-page versus absolute operand width using da65's emitted opcode-byte comments
7. namespaces or removes nonsemantic automatic labels
8. writes the final bank assembly under `src\banks`

The adapter initially exposed several incompatibilities, all caught by exact rebuilding:

- external constants were emitted as duplicate in-ROM labels
- automatic `Lxxxx` labels collided between the two fixed banks
- ca65 location aliases such as `$DFFF := * + 2` are not asm6f syntax
- four-digit automatic zero-page labels caused asm6f to widen 28 instructions

The final adapter removes only metadata aliases, converts nonsemantic automatic labels back to numeric operands, and uses opcode mode information to retain the original width. The resulting source assembles exactly.

### Headless Ghidra

Ghidra 12.1.3 was used through `GHIDRA_HOME`. The locally available GhidraNes package was investigated, but its loader was not registered by this Ghidra installation in headless mode. The production workflow therefore uses Ghidra's built-in `BinaryLoader` and `scripts\ghidra\CreateDw4Memory.java` to construct the verified mapper layout directly:

- banks `$00-$0E` and `$10-$1E` are overlays at `$8000`
- bank `$0F` is an overlay at `$C000`
- bank `$1F` is the primary raw block at `$C000`

`SeedBankCode.java` imports curated and FCEUX-observed entry points. Ghidra auto-analysis follows their control flow. `ExportBankCode.java` writes contiguous instruction ranges with physical-bank identities to ignored `analysis\ghidra-code-ranges.tsv`.

The first runtime-seeded Ghidra pass exported 27,609 instructions in 722 ranges. A dense data region at bank `$1F:$F7F5-$F802` was falsely decoded as code, including `BCC` targets into instruction operands. Those concrete false-positive ranges are recorded in `config\code-exclusions.tsv` and rejected before generation.

### FCEUX Runtime Evidence

FCEUX 2.6.6 was used as an external runtime dependency resolved through `DW4_FCEUX` or `PATH`. Emulator distributions remain outside Git publication.

The initial per-address hook design registered 32,768 callbacks and was unusably slow. The native CDL Lua functions visible in the executable are not exposed to ordinary Lua in this build. The final tracer uses one range callback:

```lua
memory.registerexec(0x8000, 0x8000, callback)
```

It also hooks writes to `$8000-$FFFF` and models the MMC1 five-write serial register protocol, including the SUROM outer-bank bit in CHR bank 0. Each executed CPU address is recorded with its active physical PRG bank.

FCEUX changes its working directory and Lua 5.1 cannot yield through `dofile`. The launcher therefore:

- starts FCEUX from its copied runtime directory
- generates one flat Lua chunk containing configuration and tracer source
- runs a bounded profile
- merges unique bank/address observations into `analysis\fceux-exec.tsv`

Three 1,800-frame deterministic profiles (`explore`, `buttons`, and `wander`) produced 11,228 unique executed instruction starts across 16 banks. Runtime observations are imported as exact one-instruction, non-recursive evidence; adjacent bytes are not inferred solely from execution coverage.

### Conversion Result At This Checkpoint

After feeding runtime observations back through Ghidra and then through da65, the accepted source contains:

- 27,622 emitted instructions
- 56,184 bytes classified as code
- 16 physical banks with mnemonic assembly
- 16 physical banks still entirely represented as data because no code entry point has been proven there
- zero analyzer warnings

The untouched banks include documented graphics/map-data banks and banks not reached by the bounded scenarios. They remain byte tables intentionally; converting them linearly would manufacture false assembly.

The final Release build has zero warnings and zero errors. It produces 524,304 bytes with SHA-256 `373BE958CB33651FE599A6B282D2A232EB3B99559C258B2C70B53DF0FA31E34A`, exactly matching the supplied ROM.

## Parallel Headless Ghidra Pass - 2026-09-20

The 32 physical PRG banks were divided into four non-overlapping headless-analysis shards:

- `$00-$07`
- `$08-$0F`
- `$10-$17`
- `$18-$1F`

Each shard used a distinct project name, ROM copy, Ghidra settings directory, cache directory, work directory, and output TSV. This prevented concurrent Ghidra processes from sharing writable project or OSGi state. `SeedBankCode.java` and `ExportBankCode.java` gained an optional physical-bank filter, passed as one underscore-delimited argument so Ghidra's headless parser would not split it.

The first two-bank probe (`$08,$0B`) verified that a shard exported only assigned banks. Four agents were then launched in parallel. Three completed on the first attempt. The `$18-$1F` import encountered a transient `ClosedException` during concurrent import and was rerun alone successfully. No analyzer process was left running.

Shard results:

| Shard | Instructions | Ranges | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `$00-$07` | 0 | 0 | No curated/runtime entry points in these banks |
| `$08-$0F` | 7,706 | 147 | Added lower fixed-bank paths |
| `$10-$17` | 8,434 | 148 | Matched monolithic instruction total |
| `$18-$1F` | derived during reconciliation | 433 | Completed successfully on isolated retry |

The shard outputs were validated for field count, hexadecimal ranges, positive instruction counts, assigned-bank membership, duplicates, and overlaps. They contained 728 ranges versus 722 monolithic ranges. Per-bank comparison found:

- bank `$0F`: shard gained 332 instructions / 707 bytes
- bank `$1F`: shard lost 136 instructions / 267 bytes because cross-bank context was absent
- all other populated banks: equal instruction totals

Blind concatenation or wholesale replacement would therefore have regressed bank `$1F`. `scripts\reconcile-ghidra-shards.ps1` selects the richer valid result independently for every physical bank and rejects overlapping selected ranges. Only bank `$0F` selected its shard output; bank `$1F` retained the monolithic result.

After code exclusions, opcode/range validation, da65 generation, and exact assembly, the reconciled result is:

- bank `$0F`: 6,072 instructions / 12,494 bytes
- total: 27,934 instructions / 56,840 bytes
- analyzer warnings: none
- build warnings/errors: 0/0
- output size: 524,304 bytes
- SHA-256: `373BE958CB33651FE599A6B282D2A232EB3B99559C258B2C70B53DF0FA31E34A`
- exact reference match: yes

## Physical Bank $00 Classification - 2026-09-20

Bank `$00` was investigated before attempting any linear disassembly. It has no execution observations and no valid code entry point, but that alone did not establish its purpose. The controlling evidence came from the fixed-bank stream reader and bank `$16` decoder.

### Stream Reader

The fixed-bank routine at `$DF7A`:

1. saves the current PRG bank
2. selects the physical bank in RAM `$51`
3. reads three bytes through pointer `$49/$4A` into `$98-$9A`
4. restores the prior PRG bank

Its pointer increment helper rolls over at CPU address `$BFD8`, not `$C000`. For physical banks `$00-$03`, rollover selects the next bank and resets the pointer to `$8000`. After bank `$04`, the stream continues through banks `$1A/$1B`. The final 40 bytes of banks `$00-$04` are therefore excluded from the stream.

### Text Index And Huffman Decoder

Bank `$16:$874C` maps a text ID to a two-byte pointer in the table at `$8951`. The text ID is divided into groups of 32. Thresholds at `$8A01` map groups as follows:

- groups `$00-$19`: bank `$00`
- groups `$1A-$27`: bank `$01`
- groups `$28-$35`: bank `$02`
- groups `$36-$40`: bank `$03`
- groups `$41-$4A`: bank `$04`
- groups `$4B-$55`: bank `$1A`
- groups `$56-$57`: bank `$1B`

Bank `$16:$87A8` consumes the `$98-$9A` buffer most-significant-bit first. Each bit selects one of two 93-byte node tables at `$87D8` and `$8835`, starting at node `$5C`. A selected value with bit 7 set is a leaf and emits `value & $7F`; symbol `$46` terminates a message.

This is a binary-tree Huffman decoder for dialogue. The decoded text is coherent English and includes combat messages, status effects, equipment/inventory prompts, shops, and NPC dialogue. This rules out executable code, graphics, map compression, and audio for bank `$00`.

### Decoder Result

`TextDecoder.cs` now decodes bank `$00` during `Dw4Tool extract`:

- 26 groups (`$00-$19`)
- 32 messages per group
- 832 total message IDs
- zero missing terminators or invalid tree nodes
- exact stream rollover from bank `$00:$BFD7` to bank `$01:$8000`

The output files are:

- `analysis\text-bank-00.tsv`: IDs, groups, pointers, bit ranges, raw symbols, and rendered text
- `analysis\text-bank-00.md`: readable message listing
- `src\banks\bank_00.asm`: compressed bytes with group labels and decoded text comments

The first messages include `The wagon isn't here.`, `Not enough MP.`, and battle-result strings. The final group contains shop dialogue and crosses into bank `$01` exactly as the ROM reader does.

Known characters and punctuation are rendered as ASCII. Unresolved symbols remain explicit `<XX>` tokens. Frequent values `$47-$4C` are clearly substitutions/control operations (for example numbers, item/entity names, conditional pluralization, and formatting), but they are not assigned final names until their handlers are fully traced.

The bank footer is separately labeled:

- `$BFD8`: compatibility reset stub/stream rollover boundary
- `$BFE0`: `DRAGON QUEST IV` title signature
- `$BFFA`: three vectors targeting `$BFD8`

Adding labels and comments does not change the compressed payload. The rebuilt ROM remains byte-identical.

A separate Visual Studio 2026 `Debug|x64` build was also completed. Before the explicit-conversion cleanup it produced nine C4244/C4267 warnings inherited from asm6f; after the bounded casts and `size_t` correction, both Debug and Release rebuild with zero warnings and zero errors. Both configurations produce a 524,304-byte ROM with the exact reference SHA-256.

## All-Bank Classification Pass - 2026-09-20

The next pass classified every physical PRG bank before adding semantic labels. The resulting concise map is `BANK_MAP.md`; the detailed evidence and important cautions are recorded here.

### Verified Bank Entry Directories

The fixed-bank IRQ/BRK dispatcher treats the two bytes following a `BRK` as a bank-local service request. The first byte selects an entry in a little-endian pointer directory at CPU `$8000`; the encoded second byte selects the physical bank and call mode. This explains why many switchable banks begin with pointers and why their code was invisible to vector-only recursive analysis.

`config\code-entry-tables.tsv` records verified directory bounds. `Dw4Tool` and Ghidra both read this file and seed
only in-window, non-null targets. The directories registered by this checkpoint were:

| Bank | Range | Entries | Broad subsystem |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `$08` | `$8000-$803B` | 30 | map tile and tileset services |
| `$0E` | `$8000-$8007` | 4 | graphics and palette services |
| `$10` | `$8000-$807F` | 64 | battle-side party/status services |
| `$11` | `$8000-$8031` | 25 | battle action/state services |
| `$12` | `$8000-$8063` | 50 | battle setup/combat services |
| `$13` | `$8000-$8037` | 28 | battle AI, action effects, resistance, and state routing |
| `$14` | `$8000-$8033` | 26 | monster graphics, battle display, and Necrosaro transformations |
| `$15` | `$8000-$8033` | 26 | item/effect scripts and inventory |
| `$16` | `$8000-$8027` | 20 | text and UI services |
| `$17` | `$8000-$804B` | 38 | map services and information |
| `$18` | `$8000-$8045` | 35 | mixed battle data/code directory |
| `$19` | `$8000-$8013` | 10 | map/tileset asset selection |
| `$1B` | `$8000-$801F` | 16 | mixed map-event services and text overlay |
| `$1C` | `$8000-$802B` | 22 | mixed map/entity services |
| `$1E` | `$8000-$808F` | 72 | map and field-command services |

Bank `$10:$8080` is a coherent wrapper immediately after its directory but is not itself a directory target, so it has a separate direct seed. Bank `$18` demonstrates why directory parsing must still be conservative: entry `$0A` points to a record table at `$8046`, not executable code.

After these targets were integrated, static output initially reached 42,191 instructions / 84,800 bytes across 19 physical banks. Subsequent exclusion fixes, BRK-aware continuation analysis, inline-call handling, nested dispatch-table recovery, and missing-directory registration produced the checkpoint result of 62,799 instructions occupying 125,270 unique PRG byte positions across 18 banks.

`config\bank-classifications.tsv` records one Verified dominant classification for each of the 32 physical banks, so dominant PRG classification is 524,288 / 524,288 bytes (100%). `config\content-ranges.tsv` supplies the more granular bounded data classifications. `Dw4Tool extract` unions those ranges with unique instruction-byte positions and writes `analysis\classification-report.txt`. Detailed classification at this checkpoint was 444,702 / 524,288 PRG bytes (84.82%): 125,270 instruction bytes, 320,998 ranged data bytes, and 1,566 intentional dual-use bytes counted once. The remaining 79,586 bytes still needed table/routine-level classification.

### Asset Banks Are Not Code-Coverage Targets

Once a bank is established as map, text, graphics, sound, or other asset data, it is excluded from machine-code analysis. Its bytes remain losslessly represented and should eventually move to a format-specific extractor/encoder; converting them to 6502 mnemonics is neither necessary nor useful. Mixed banks remain range-based: verified executable loaders, decoders, or drivers are assembly, while their asset ranges stay data.

This rule corrected a concrete false positive in physical bank `$0B`. Ghidra had linearly decoded three ranges inside the documented overworld map data (`$AF61-$B033`, `$BE1F-$BEF3`, and `$BF36-$BF7B`) as 255 instructions. The ranges were removed by classifying the complete bank as non-executable map data, and the Ghidra exporter now applies the same exclusions before reconciliation.

### Complete Huffman Text Decode

The decoder now handles all 88 groups (`$00-$57`) and all 2,816 message IDs across banks `$00-$04/$1A/$1B`. It writes `analysis\text.tsv` and one Markdown report per physical text bank.

The fixed reader's rollover behavior was reproduced exactly:

- bank `$00` -> `$01:$8000`
- bank `$01` -> `$02:$8000`
- bank `$02` -> `$03:$8000`
- bank `$03` -> `$04:$8000`
- bank `$04` -> `$1A:$8000`
- bank `$1A` -> `$1B:$8000`
- bank `$1B` -> pointer entry `$0A` at `$1B:$8014`, whose value is `$B78A`

Several groups cross those boundaries. Because the decoder fetches three-byte bit buffers, adjacent streams can share one or two source bytes:

| Group | Initial pointer | Continuation consumed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$19` | `$00:$BBD8` | `$01:$8000-$8025` |
| `$26` | `$01:$BE35` | `$02:$8000-$83E4` |
| `$35` | `$02:$BCF3` | `$03:$8000-$833B` |
| `$40` | `$03:$BD2B` | `$04:$8000-$81CF` |
| `$4A` | `$04:$B904` | `$1A:$8000-$8072` |
| `$55` | `$1A:$BB5D` | `$1B:$8000-$832E` |
| `$57` | `$1B:$BF75` | `$1B:$B78A-$BCEA` through the final continuation pointer |

Bank `$1B` therefore contains genuine dual-use bytes where group `$55` overlaps the leading event directory, code, and record data. Those bytes must retain both interpretations; group `$57` instead resumes in the compressed-text tail at `$B78A`.

### Bank $05: Map Entity Records

Bank `$05:$8000-$8091` contains 73 little-endian pointers, exactly one for each map number represented by the map metadata. Bank `$1C:$9B12-$9B33` computes `CurrentMapNumber * 2 + $8000`, selects physical bank `$05`, reads the pointer through the fixed-bank generic reader, and expands the selected record into entity arrays around `$6F60-$7160`.

The pointer table and the record area beginning at `$8092` are labeled separately. Exact per-record field semantics still need to be derived; the broad NPC/entity/event role is directly established by the consumer.

### Banks $06-$07: Compressed Monster Graphics

Both banks are data-only compressed monster graphics. Standard NES 2bpp contact sheets were initially generated at byte alignment 0 and 8:

- bank `$06`: 1,024 unique tiles, zero blank tiles
- bank `$07`: 1,024 unique tiles, zero blank tiles
- shifted variants: 1,023 unique tiles, zero/one blank tile
- known raw graphics bank `$0C`: 996 unique tiles and seven blank tiles
- known raw graphics bank `$0D`: 970 unique tiles and 25 blank tiles

The bank `$06/$07` renders are high-entropy noise rather than recognizable tiles, while `$0C/$0D` render as obvious map art. Packed-pixel, interleaved-plane, and one-bitplane tests also fail. This is expected because the ROM bytes are compressed source streams rather than direct tile planes.

The direct consumer is in the battle engine in physical bank `$14`:

1. `$9F26-$9F65` selects the graphics bank from the monster ID in `$C4`. Ordinary IDs index the 25-byte MSB-first bitmap at `$B398-$B3B0`; a clear bit selects bank `$06` and a set bit selects bank `$07`. Six special IDs select embedded graphics in banks `$10/$14`.
2. `$9FA9-$9FEA` indexes `$B3B1 + monsterId * 5` and loads a five-byte descriptor: chunk count, little-endian compressed-stream pointer, and two layout bytes.
3. `$9F66-$9F8C` calls the fixed-bank helper at `$C7E1`, temporarily selects the descriptor's physical bank, and copies a 17-byte source window to `$0108-$0118`.
4. `$9F8D-$9FA8` returns the next compressed byte and advances the source pointer, refilling as needed.
5. `$9712-$9782` interprets the stream and reconstructs 16-byte bitplanes at `$0650/$0660`, then rearranges the decoded bytes at `$0670` for battle presentation.

The descriptor table has 194 records (`$00-$C1`) and occupies `$B3B1-$B77A`. It selects 124 records from bank `$06` through 46 unique stream pointers (`$8000-$BDE1`) and 64 records from bank `$07` through 23 unique pointers (`$8000-$AEA3`). All pointers are valid switchable-window addresses and none point into a compatibility footer. This traced consumer and decoded output establish both banks as `CompressedMonsterGraphics` with Verified confidence.

### Banks $10-$14: Battle System

These banks are linked by the fixed-bank service-directory ABI and shared battle RAM:

- `$10` repeatedly reads/writes party save slots and battle records, including `$72EA`, `$72E6`, and `$7274`; its services cover party membership, statistics, status, and rewards.
- `$11` manipulates battle state in `$72E7-$735C` and arena state `$6E81`; it is labeled battle action/state services.
- `$12:$8064` initializes battle globals, `$80B4` clears `$7274-$72E3`, and `$810E` copies active party combatants from `$6E45-$6E48` to battle RAM. This is direct battle setup evidence.
- `$13` routes on battle state `$6E80`, indexes combatant arrays in `$72xx/$73xx`, and evaluates battle-AI actions, effect rolls, resistance, and state transitions.
- `$14` decodes monster graphics, places monster display slots, drives battle-screen animation, and performs the ordered Necrosaro transformations while synchronizing display work with NMI.

At this checkpoint the labels remained subsystem-level. The 2026-09-28/29 all-body naming audits later completed
the individual attack, spell, AI, display, and animation routine names.

### Bank $15: Effect Scripts And Inventory

Bank `$15` is mixed data and code:

- `$8000-$8033`: 26-entry service directory
- `$8034-$963F`: dense table-driven command streams
- `$9640-$98F7`: little-endian pointers back into those streams
- `$98F8`: interpreter entry that resolves a stream pointer and dispatches command bytes
- `$B374`: initializes the 128-byte vault/inventory storage region beginning at `$61DB`

The stream bytes are retained as data. They are not linearly disassembled.

### Bank $18: Monster Records And Fonts

Entry `$0A` of bank `$18`'s mixed directory points to `$8046`. From there, 214 consecutive records of exactly 22 bytes occupy `$8046-$92A9`. Battle setup code reads fields from this table into the documented monster/combatant RAM arrays, supporting the `MonsterRecords` classification.

The directory's remaining non-null targets produce coherent battle/arena code. To stop the data target from becoming a false `ORA ($00,X)` path, `$8046-$92A9` is in `config\code-exclusions.tsv`.

Runtime execution at `$B798` proves a separate font loader. It writes PPU address `$1000`, then emits one source byte followed by one zero byte per row through `PPUDATA`, constructing two-plane NES tiles from one-bitplane glyph data. Contact sheets confirm:

- `$B83D-$BC9C`: 140 digits, lowercase letters, punctuation, icons, and UI fragments
- `$BC9D-$BDBC`: 36 uppercase/digit glyphs

These ranges are also excluded from code seeding. An isolated Ghidra shard seeded 30 valid directory targets, exported 29 code ranges, and produced zero overlap with either verified data range.

### Banks $19 And $1B-$1E

- `$19` is now fully detailed. Audio dispatch and map-music selection occupy `$8000-$814D`; 54 four-channel audio pointer records occupy `$814E-$82FD`; 54 external sequence-bank selectors occupy `$82FE-$8333`; audio sequence, instrument, envelope, and effect data runs through `$BF7D`; padding and the compatibility footer complete the bank.
- `$1B` combines map-local event/entity code with the dual-use text overlays described above.
- `$1C:$9B12` is the proven consumer of bank `$05` map-entity records. The bank also contains a mixed directory, structured event data, and map/entity service code.
- `$1D` manipulates map coordinates, entity arrays `$6F60-$71FF`, event state, and scripted transitions.
- `$1E` has a 72-entry service directory followed by map interaction, movement, collision, and entity-event code.

The source labels identify these broad boundaries without claiming that every field or routine inside the mixed banks is understood.

## Detailed Backlog Pass - 2026-09-20

The first largest-range pass increased detailed classification from 356,174 bytes (67.93%) to 380,162 bytes (72.51%), a gain of 23,988 bytes. The remaining detailed backlog is 144,126 bytes in 1,217 exact intervals.

### Bank $19 Completion

Bank `$19` moved from 1.37% to 100% detailed classification:

- `$804D-$804F`, `$806C-$806E`, `$80C9-$80CB`, and `$80F2-$80F4` are inline operands consumed by the fixed-bank `$x3/$xB` BRK modes. Their continuation addresses were added as code seeds.
- `$810B-$814D` contains map, submap, chapter, and tileset lookup data.
- `$814E-$82FD` contains 54 eight-byte records, each holding four audio-channel sequence pointers.
- `$82FE-$8333` contains 54 external sequence-bank selectors used by the fixed audio engine.
- `$8334-$BF7D` contains audio sequence, instrument, envelope, and effect data.
- `$BF7E-$BFD7` is `$FF` padding; `$BFD8-$BFFF` is the compatibility footer.

### Bank $14 Metadata

Detailed coverage in bank `$14` reached 52.94%. The pass bounded:

- seven nested battle-presentation pointers at `$A40D-$A41A`
- the monster identifier ordering table at `$B2D5-$B397`
- the 25-byte monster graphics bank bitmap at `$B398-$B3B0`
- 194 five-byte monster graphics descriptors at `$B3B1-$B77A`

An initial eight-entry interpretation of `$A40D` was rejected because `$A41B` is the first handler, not another pointer. The seven-entry boundary preserves that code path.

### Bank $08 Tile Data

Detailed coverage in bank `$08` reached 84.20%. The verified continuous tile-data domain now includes:

- runtime-read auxiliary map/tile records at `$979B-$A1BA`
- special tile-pattern data at `$A1E5-$A28C`
- 176 records of four graphics pointers at `$A28D-$A80C`
- three-byte logical tile definitions at `$A80D-$AEB6`
- 22 animated-tile pointers at `$AEB7-$AEE2`

The apparent code starts at `$979B/$A80D` were pointer-directory data targets and are now excluded from instruction analysis.

## BRK And Dispatch Backlog Pass - 2026-09-20

The continuation pass raised detailed classification from 380,162 bytes (72.51%) to 435,634 bytes (83.09%), a gain of 55,472 bytes. The remaining backlog is 88,654 bytes.

- `CodeAnalyzer` now resumes switchable-bank BRK service calls, learning two- versus three-byte operand counts only from verified `InlineServiceOperands` ranges. Recursive paths stop at declared code exclusions.
- Bank `$11`'s fixed helper at `$BF2E` was decoded as a JSR ABI that consumes one byte after the call and advances the stacked return address. Handling that ABI and the nested dispatch tables at `$8FDC/$A40A` raised bank `$11` to 93.96%.
- Bank `$17` reached 100% detailed coverage after separating BRK operands, UI templates, PPU descriptors, CHR-RAM graphics, map patterns, animation command streams, padding, and the compatibility footer.
- Bank `$08` reached 96.31% after bounding per-map routing records, transition records, the variable map/submap stream, coordinate records, padding, and the footer.
- Bank `$1C` reached 78.14% after recovering its 74-entry map/submap handler table at `$AC8A` and 51-entry event table at `$BF4B`.

A subsequent bank `$1B` asset pass classified 2,246 additional byte positions. Code at `$9485-$95A7` proves a 23-byte OAM tile-ID table at `$95C9`, seven 25-byte sprite layouts at `$95E0`, and their selection formula. The aligned `$9690-$9E8F` block renders as 128 coherent raw NES 2bpp sprite tiles in `analysis\bank1b-9690-9e8f-tiles.png`. Its final zero byte is intentionally dual-use as the verified BRK entry at `$9E8F`.

## Review Checkpoint - 2026-09-20

This checkpoint stops at 444,702 detailed bytes (84.82%), with 79,586 bytes unclassified. No range from the in-progress bank `$14` compressed-graphics investigation was promoted.

- `ConvertDa65Output` now preserves da65 interior aliases written as `Name := * + n`, converting them to asm6f-compatible `Name = $ + n`. Regenerated source and the native Release build again reproduce the exact reference ROM.
- Bank `$16:$A4FF-$AAF6` is split into the directly consumed text/UI pointer base, 113-entry record directory, command directories, dispatch tables, and variable interpreter records.
- Bank `$18:$92AA-$9959` contains 107 fixed-size 16-byte encounter records. Every one of the 1,498 list slots is either a valid monster ID `$00-$D5` or sentinel `$FF`.
- Bank `$18:$A27B-$A812` contains encounter-rate and weight tables, 35 eight-byte battle formations, a 73-entry map stride table, three 256-byte world encounter grids, two map-keyed encounter streams, and the battle-data pointer used at `$A876`.
- Registering bank `$1D`'s verified 21-entry service directory recovered its previously omitted map-transition code. Pointers at `$925A/$944E` prove NMI callback continuations at `$9273/$9467`; their motion and PPU tables are typed separately.
- Bank `$14:$B77B-$BCFF` appeared to participate in an 81-entry compressed graphics stream corpus selected through `$B1BA`, but stream consumption and the dual-use boundary across code at `$BD00` were not yet bounded. It remained unclassified at this checkpoint.

From the preceding 83.52% checkpoint, this pass added 6,822 detailed byte positions: 1,970 instruction bytes and 4,854 ranged-data bytes, with two new dual-use positions. The exact 524,304-byte build remains the acceptance gate.

No broad unknown ranges were added. Orphaned opcode-like regions such as bank `$13:$9276-$A4E7` remain unclassified because no verified control-flow edge or runtime seed reaches them.

### Remaining Priority At That Checkpoint

The largest unclassified intervals at this checkpoint were:

| Bank and range | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| `$13:$9276-$A4E7` | 4,722 |
| `$12:$AF89-$B520` | 1,432 |
| `$14:$B77B-$BCFF` | 1,413 |
| `$0F:$F625-$FABD` | 1,177 |
| `$12:$8A36-$8EAC` | 1,143 |
| `$12:$97A9-$9BFC` | 1,108 |
| `$13:$A9C0-$AE10` | 1,105 |
| `$10:$A701-$AB4E` | 1,102 |
| `$1D:$870F-$8B1D` | 1,039 |
| `$0F:$FB6C-$FF73` | 1,032 |

These intervals remain unclassified at table/routine granularity. Their containing banks still retain Verified dominant classifications; no range is promoted merely to increase the percentage.

## Completion Gate Milestone - 2026-09-21

`verify-completion.cmd` now enforces the project-wide evidence gate:

- all 143 original unsupported-opcode/data-walk cases remain accounted for, and 45 additional warnings exposed by later control-flow recovery are also classified
- all 1,955 pointer entries have verified boundaries; all 1,871 executable targets decode, and all 42 currently decoded indirect jumps have reviewed dispositions
- all 7,123 former `BankXX_Code_XXXX` labels are replaced by subsystem-qualified entry or branch labels while curated semantic labels take precedence
- at this milestone, 3,992 pointer-, call-, or seed-proven routine starts had generated register/memory/call interfaces and 35 high-confidence routines had extraction-validated semantic contracts; current totals are maintained in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)
- 26 manifest slices cover text, maps, graphics, palettes, and audio and round-trip to the exact ROM hash
- FCEUX evidence passes 12 assertions across startup, banking, menus, maps, battle, text, save/load initialization, audio, and graphics
- SRAM tracing observes complete writes for 15 named fields and the contiguous `$6001-$62EE` initialization span; recovered code uses battery SRAM directly and contains no verified separate serializer or checksum pass
- the final 524,304-byte ROM matches SHA-256 `373BE958CB33651FE599A6B282D2A232EB3B99559C258B2C70B53DF0FA31E34A`

The current totals, per-bank backlog, and semantic completion definition now live only in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md). The gate deliberately does not inflate semantic coverage by guessing.

## Largest Unclassified Block Pass - 2026-09-22

Bank `$14:$A111-$A3F0` is exactly 46 aligned 16-byte NES 2bpp tiles. A standard planar render produces coherent mirrored forms, expected blank tiles, and multi-tile artwork rather than the high-entropy noise seen when compressed streams are rendered directly. This satisfies the graphics-evidence rule even though no static pointer or captured runtime read currently identifies the consumer.

The range is now typed as raw battle graphics. Detailed classification increased by 736 bytes to 503,805 / 524,288 (96.09%), leaving 20,483 bytes in 703 ranges. The exact-ROM completion gate continues to pass.
e
The descending pass then established four additional data domains:

- Bank `$10:$BD2A-$BF53` is the compressed monster stream selected for monster ID `$B1` by descriptor `$14:$B726`; `$BF54-$BFD7` is contiguous `$FF` padding.
- Bank `$12:$8A36-$8EAC` contains two 139-byte selector maps addressed through `$848F`, followed by variable setup records parsed from pointer `$8BBC`. Correcting the nested handler table from `$8491` to seven entries at `$8493` removed the false executable target at `$8AC1`.
- Five special monster descriptors select bank `$14` and stream pointer `$BE53`; `$BE4F-$BE52` holds four consumed destination offsets, `$BE53-$BFCF` is compressed graphics, and `$BFD0-$BFD7` is padding.
- Bank `$13:$B80B-$B90A` is a full 256-byte battle-AI action lookup page with several direct indexed consumers and verified code beginning at `$B90B`.

At that checkpoint, these classifications had reduced the original backlog by 3,174 bytes and raised detailed coverage to 506,243 / 524,288 (96.56%).

## Instruction And Data Recovery Pass - 2026-09-22

The next pass raised detailed coverage by another 4,237 bytes, from 96.56% to 97.37%:

- Verified instruction bytes increased by 1,524, from 155,985 to 157,509. Registering the bounded bank `$16` command-handler tables recovered normal text/UI handlers; direct seeds recovered bank `$1C:$B83A-$B8F4`, fixed-bank event helpers around `$CE09-$CF90`, and the BRK continuation at `$F11C-$F19A`.
- Explicitly ranged data increased by 2,738 bytes, from 350,914 to 353,652. New domains include bank `$08` display records, bank `$13` lookup arrays and presentation command streams, bank `$16` command data, the fixed-bank audio period table, and the dual-use UI template at `$F19B`.
- Dual-use overlap increased from 656 to 681 bytes. New reviewed overlaps occur at bank `$16:$B84A`, bank `$1F:$CE50`, and the `$F19B-$F1CA` template/code region.
- Several false instruction paths were removed, including bank `$13` command streams and the lookup table beginning at `$B967`; this reduced decoded indirect jumps from 42 to 41 and recovered-path warning cases from 45 to 42.

Cumulative unclassified PRG fell by 7,411 bytes from the original 21,219-byte checkpoint to 13,808 bytes in 708 ranges. The completion gate passes with 2,066 typed pointers, 1,968/1,968 executable targets decoded, 41/41 indirect jumps audited, 3/3 control-flow conflicts audited, and exact ROM reproduction.

## Inline-Operand ABI And Evidence-Priority Pass - 2026-09-23/24

This pass started from a provisional 99.41% claim and first reduced it to 98.38%, from 510,480 bytes (97.37%) at
the previous commit. It then rebuilt the evidence rules and reached 519,498 / 524,288 bytes (99.09%), leaving
4,790 unclassified bytes in 223 ranges. Several earlier claims turned out to be wrong and were withdrawn; they are
listed below with the reasons.

### Withdrawn provisional claims

- Lookup spans: a traced indexed consumer proves a table base, not every byte to the end of the enclosing
  unclassified interval. All 242 inferred spans (5,400 bytes) were removed. A table's extent is now taken only
  from a decoded format, an index bound in code, a sentinel, a fixed record count, runtime reads, or an
  independently proven adjacent boundary.
- A per-call-site BRK registration pass concluded that `$25,$23` was a "two-operand exception". It is not: the
  handler for selector `$23` consumes three operands, and `$12:$9C9E` decodes coherently only as
  `BRK $25,$23,$09; LDA $09; ASL A; ADC $09; TAX`.

### Inline-operand ABI from handler code

The IRQ/BRK dispatcher (`$C408`, byte-identical in both fixed banks) routes selector low nibbles `$3` and `$B`
before any service lookup. The operand counts therefore follow from the handlers themselves:

- `$C4F8` sends `$x3` selectors to bank `$10` entries `$00-$09`, bank `$10` entries `$22-$24`, or bank `$12` entries
  `$01-$03`. Each handler advances the stacked return address by an amount that depends only on the selector. For
  example, `$80D1` takes a second `INY` unless `CMP #$33` matches. This gives `$03/$13/$33/$53/$73/$A3/$B3/$E3/$F3`
  two operands, `$23/$43/$63/$93/$C3/$D3` three, and `$83` four.
- `$C4A1` increments the stacked return for `$CB/$DB/$EB`, the three-operand flag services. The other `$xB`
  selectors return through `$C38B` untouched.
- Default-family services resume at BRK+3 unless their handler moves the return address. Bank `$16` entries
  `$01/$07/$09` (`$8A18/$8A45/$8A72`) do, with `INC $0105,x` or `INC $0106,x`.
- `JSR $11:$BF2E` and `JSR $10:$8C18` each consume one inline byte. The six `$10:$8B59-$8B76` stubs are
  `JSR $8C18 / .byte n / RTS`.

`config/inline-operand-abi.tsv` records each rule with its handler. Fixed-bank BRKs now follow the same ABI. They
had been treated as terminal, which left 99 operand ranges unclassified. The original deduplicated execution trace
proved that no inline operand byte was executed, but it could not prove causal returns. Stack-correlated tracing now
proves the declared continuation for 115 call sites; 103 historical sites are retained as `legacy-address-only`.
Extraction rejects any causal observation that disagrees with the handler-derived ABI.

### Evidence priority and invalid-code rules

- Curated, pointer, runtime, and flow evidence decode first. Imported Ghidra blocks are supplementary, decoded
  with the ABI, and rejected if they start inside established code, raise any warning, or overlap a verified
  content range. The rejected Ghidra decodes included the "intentional overlap" at `$1F:$CE50`, two indirect
  jumps inside the `$1F` tile graphics, the chapter-record table at `$1E:$A599`, and the SRAM routine image at
  `$1F:$C98F` (it executes at `$6CAD`).
- A BRK whose selector names a bank without a verified service directory, or a JSR/JMP into `$0800-$5FFF`, stops
  its path. A branch that immediately follows its complement (`BCS`/`BCC`, `BNE`/`BEQ`, ...) ends fallthrough.
- A single executed-instruction observation no longer shadows real flow. The queue is keyed by visit mode, so
  the jump into `$1F:$ED4B` now reaches the fallthrough code at `$ED60`.
- Executed code inside a code exclusion is an error. That rule exposed bank `$0B`. Its whole-bank map-data claim
  had hidden a mixed service directory at `$8000` and 255 runtime-executed instructions at `$AF61`, `$BE1F`, and
  `$BF36`, which an earlier pass had dismissed as Ghidra false positives.

### Corrected existing claims

- Twenty-four code exclusions and three `OverlappingCode` ranges existed only because of wrong BRK counts. Their
  stated reasons, such as "operand byte of branch instruction", no longer matched the ROM, and they are removed.
- Fifteen directory entries typed as executable point to data. Their decodes reach unsupported opcodes, and bank
  `$13` entry `$0F` is fetched only in pointer mode. Bank `$12` entry `$2F` produced the audited "static trap"
  `JMP ($F0EE)`.
- RTS-dispatch tables store handler-1. The bank `$16` tables at `$A787/$A793` had seeded the wrong byte, which
  created the phantom `$16:$B84A` overlap. Tables now carry an `rts` dispatch column.
- Bank `$0F:$C019-$C02D` holds zero-filled trampoline slots, not JMP trampolines.
- `$0E` palette data ends at `$BE0A`. The next 223 bytes are map-coordinate link records fetched through
  directory entry `$02`.
- `$17:$9DC6` is `BCS $9D70`, not the first entry of a "ten-value table". The remaining eight bytes had no
  consumer at this checkpoint; the later final pass proved the branch is always taken and accepted them as
  `ReviewedUnusedData`.

### Warning accounting by identity

The previous gate reported "143/143 original warnings" by arithmetic. By identity, 26 of those warnings were
neither current nor recorded as resolved. `config/analyzer-warning-ledger.tsv` now records all 215 warning
identities ever tracked, including the original 143 recovered from commit `36054ed` into
`config/original-analyzer-warnings.tsv`. Extraction requires current warnings to match the ledger exactly, and it
re-checks every resolved disposition. There are 0 current warnings and 0 control-flow conflicts. This replaces
`scripts/triage-conflicts.ps1`, `config/resolved-unsupported-opcodes.tsv`, and
`config/control-flow-conflicts.tsv`.

The warning ledger and original inventory are also covered by `config/analyzer-warning-manifest.tsv`. Extraction
fails if reason text changes or a post-original resolved identity is deleted without updating the reviewed manifest.
The final code/content intersection must exactly match `config/code-data-overlaps.tsv`, so runtime, curated, pointer,
guarded, and Ghidra seeds cannot silently create new code inside typed data.

### Newly typed content

The new ranges fall into these kinds:

- Index-bounded tables, with each citation checked by extraction.
- Sentinel-terminated record lists.
- RTS-dispatch tables whose value+1 targets all decode.
- Fully runtime-read tables, since FCEUX does not log dummy reads.
- The structurally tiled map regions in bank `$0B`.
- Fixed-bank footers and the NMI trampoline pointer.

The largest items are:

- Bank `$0B`: rows, row records, location maps, and composition tables, all proven by exact tiling or by
  simulating the consumer over every record.
- Bank `$12:$9135-$91DC`: eleven loop-bounded tables.
- Bank `$1C:$9F8A-$A00F`: two `$FF`-terminated record lists.
- Bank `$14:$A621-$A67E`: step and palette tables.

The unreferenced routine at `$14:$AF53` is seeded from call consistency. It makes five JSRs to decoded
fixed-bank routines and two internal calls.

### Remaining backlog

The remaining 4,790 bytes have no evidence strong enough to type them:

- The bank `$12`, `$10`, and `$18` script-like regions need their interpreter identified.
- Several tables need variable ranges that are not yet proven (`$62D5`, `$7599`).
- Short unreferenced fragments between routines stay unclassified rather than being called padding or code
  without a consumer.

## Evidence-Hardening Stopping Point - 2026-09-24

After hardening the validators and classifying only ranges with explicit masks, loop counts, sentinels, record
counts, RTS-dispatch targets, or independently proven boundaries, detailed coverage is 520,308 / 524,288 bytes
(99.24%). The remaining backlog is 3,980 bytes in 212 ranges. This is an 810-byte net reduction from the 99.09%
checkpoint while also removing ten unsupported instruction bytes at bank `$13:$B7B0-$B7B9`.

Newly closed content includes exact map-override and tile-pattern tables in bank `$08`, duplicated bounded battle
tables in banks `$10/$13`, fixed-size battle and map records in banks `$12-$1E`, masked fixed-bank tables, and the
24-entry bank `$1F:$E812-$E841` audio RTS-dispatch table. Registering that table recovered all 36 handler bytes at
`$E842-$E865` as code through value+1 targets rather than opcode appearance.

The remaining large ranges were intentionally open at this checkpoint. Directory targets alone did not prove the
extents of bank `$10` and `$12` data, `$12:$B977-$BA3D` had no consumer, bank `$18:$ADA3-$AE4E` depended on the
unbounded value `$62D5`, and the larger bank `$13/$1E` tables still had variable-derived endpoints. Later passes
closed these ranges through interpreter discovery, variable-range proofs, and targeted runtime reads.

## Index-Bound Ledger And Title-Menu Pass - 2026-09-27

This pass took detailed coverage from 523,911 bytes (99.93%, 377 bytes in 42 ranges) to 524,226 / 524,288 bytes
(99.99%). It left 62 bytes in 13 ranges, recorded at that checkpoint with their blockers. Some earlier claims were
wrong and are recorded below, including changes that lowered the metric.

### New enforcement

- `config/index-bounds.tsv` and `tools/Dw4Tool/IndexBounds.cs`: each row caps one decoded absolute-indexed
  consumer to a cited index range. Extraction fails if a source-attributed runtime read or a recorded X/Y
  observation falls outside the bound, or if any byte the bound can reach is untyped. Opcode fetches and
  interrupt-vector reads logged with the consumer's PC are excluded from the cross-check. The ledger has 149 rows.
- The reviewed-unused rule is now strict: an indexed reference covers base through base+255 unless an index
  bound caps it. There is no exemption for bases inside other content ranges.

### Corrections

- The strict rule showed that three reviewed-unused claims were read. `$13:$94EC-$951A`, `$10:$95EF-$9600`, and
  `$1D:$B285-$B287` are now typed from their readers.
- Six reviewed-unused claims were withdrawn because no index bound could be proven for a reference that reaches
  them: `$0F/$1F:$DFF0`, `$12:$914C-$914F`, `$12:$91D1-$91D7`, `$16:$A4D6-$A4DD`, `$16:$BC41-$BC42`, and
  `$1F:$ED49-$ED4A`. All six remain unclassified.
- A proposed bound of `$00-$38` for `$12:$9006` was rejected by the tool, because runtime observed X up to 63.
  The bound is `$00-$3F`.
- `$17:$9DC8-$9DCF` lost an unsupported code exclusion and the label `Bank17_MapTimingValues`. It is reviewed-unused
  because the `BCS $9D70` at `$9DC6` is always taken.
- `$16:$B71F` was recorded as reviewed-unused, but it is the final `D` of `END` in the keyboard list. FCEUX read it
  from `$AF4F` during hero naming. The list is now `$B699-$B71F`: a three-byte header plus six rows of `$16`
  characters. The code at `$B720` is the handler that the RTS-biased pointer `$B71F` selects, which is how the
  earlier boundary was misplaced.
- `$16:$B755` (`TextUiPartyCounts`) and `$16:$B785` (`TextUiPartyClasses`) were misnamed. They are the title-menu
  row counts per slot mask and the adventure-log row counts (population counts). They are now `TitleMenuRowCounts`
  and `AdventureLogRowCounts`.

### Runtime tooling

`scripts/trace-fceux.ps1` gained `-TraceMode script -InputScript <file>` for frame-scheduled button input and GD
snapshots ("`<frame> <count> <buttons>`" or "`<frame> shot`"). It also gained `-BatteryOnly` to boot from an
archive's battery RAM without loading its snapshot, and `-TimeoutSeconds`. All data from these runs merges into the
normal `analysis/fceux-*.tsv` corpus.

### Newly typed content part 2

- Guest-class tables `$10:$8540`, `$10:$8F28`, `$10:$8FE5`, `$1E:$96A3`, and `$16:$AB50`. Guest classes 8-14
  come from the join handler at `$10:$93DA-$93F7` with arguments at `$1D:$B787`, `$1C:$B667`, and `$1C:$B63D`.
  Class 15 is held in savestates 25-28.
- `$18:$ADA3-$ADAE` party-level brackets, bounded by the capped level increment.
- Title-menu tables `$16:$B1E8`, `$B1F0`, `$B232-$B249`, `$B964`, and `$B96C`. `$03DC` is the three-bit slot mask
  that `$B78C-$B79E` builds. Handler `$B74B` (UI record `$53`) or `$B773` (records `$54/$55`) stores it, and those
  records are the only users of set-1 commands one and two and of selection handlers six and seven. Scripted
  COPY/ERASE walks from `States/state20.zip` battery RAM exercised all eight masks, and every table byte was read.
- Text-input tables `$16:$A151`, `$16:$AEFB`, and `$12:$BB01`, indexed by list number `$03DD`. Record `$57` is the
  only record that selects a list, and it selects list eight. The other slots are typed by base and following code,
  with their unreached status stated in the reasons.
- Dialogue row offsets `$16:$AE50/$AE72`, for records `$43/$50` and `$3D/$5F`, which declare four rows through
  `$B650`. These have no runtime reads.
- `$16:$AB2E`: the third display code, read while the field STATUS screen opened window `$0D`.
- `$12:$8614-$861A`: seven message-speed delays. Both paths into `$860D` exclude speed index seven.
- `$12:$BBCC-$BBD3`: column masks. Y comes from the bank `$16:$9C7F` metric row, whose values are 0, 1, 2, 6, and 8.
- `$11:$926B-$9271`: Necrosaro form IDs for stages one to seven. `$7206` has other writers, so the ceiling rests on
  the `$D2` terminal check at `$920E` rather than a proof that `$7206` changes only here.

### Continuation: 62 to 15 bytes

Detailed coverage is now 524,273 / 524,288 (99.997%). The ledger holds 166 index bounds and 53 reviewed-unused
ranges.

Proofs added:

- `$08:$8AA2-$8AAE`: `$07` is the tileset passed to bank `$08` service two, from bank `$17` MapInfo submap records
  masked with `$3F`. Every one of the seventy-three maps' records (each list ends at an `$FF`) holds a value from one
  to `$32`, so Y = `$07` >> 2 is at most `$0C`.
- `$12:$914C-$914F` and `$12:$91D1-$91D7` are reviewed-unused. `SaveCurrentChapterMinus1` is at most four. The
  chapter-end INC at `$1B:$AC02` runs only for chapters zero to three, the `$12:$9067` store writes four, and the
  chapter-select writers are dead because `LDA $C000 / AND #$08 / BNE` at `$1E:$A35B` always branches (`$C000` holds
  `$FF`). No indexed store reaches `$615A`.
- `$12:$8614-$861A`: both paths into `$860D` exclude message speed seven.
- `$12:$BB01` and `$12:$BBCC`: the bank `$12` text-input and column tables. The column count comes from the bank
  `$16:$9C7F` metric row.
- `$16:$A151`, `$AE50`, `$AE72`, `$AEFB`, `$AD47`, and `$AB2E`: text-input, dialogue-row, status-selector and
  display-code tables. Record-level proofs cover every opener and embedded command byte.
- `$16:$A4D6-$A4DD` is reviewed-unused. Its only uncapped readers, `$A1CD/$A1DA`, are on the list-zero path, which
  never runs because record `$57`, the only mode-`$0D` window, stores list eight.
- `$1D:$AEFE-$AF05`: map event `$64` fires only inside two `82 08 ... 81` object-script loops, so the loop counter
  is eight down to one.
- `$1F:$ED49`: the 99th audio period entry, ending at the normalization routine.
- `$11:$926B`: Necrosaro form IDs. The ceiling rests on the `$D2` terminal check, because `$7206` has other
  writers.

Corrections:

- The `$16:$BC35` pair count and the `$16:$BC29/$BC2F` bounds assumed `$10:$9613` returns zero through six. It
  returns up to seven (poison), so the table has seven pairs.
- The `$16:$A4CE` evidence misattributed its Y mask.
- Both are fixed.

Tooling:

- A map-object script walker (scratch, not yet in `Dw4Tool`) enumerates bank `$05` and `$1C` entity lists and
  their length-prefixed script blocks, using command lengths read from the fixed-bank handlers.
- It reproduces all 181 runtime-fetched command sites.
- It shows that script memory writes target only `$00F9`, `$0530`, and flags `$627B-$62AA`.

The remaining 15 bytes were recorded with their blockers at this checkpoint; the final closure is recorded below.

### Final byte-classification closure

Detailed coverage is now 524,288 / 524,288 bytes (100%), with 169 enforced index bounds and 53 reviewed-unused
ranges. The final four proofs were:

- `$1C:$B7A3-$B7A4`: the reader at `$B79F` is reached only after `($6299 & $7F)` passes explicit lower bound `$08`
  and upper bound `$3F` checks.
- `$1D:$B363-$B366`: paired map events `$79/$7A` constrain `PlayerLocalY` to 9 or 11 and hold it under negative
  cutscene state `$0530`; the two readers at `$B33D/$B34A` therefore use X zero or two.
- `$0F/$1F:$DFF0`: only invalid map-object command `$C6` selects this dispatch byte. The sole `$C6` adjacent to a
  declared script follows `$05:$B7D4-$B7F7`, whose reachable path unconditionally redirects through command `$84`
  at `$B7DA` to `$B7CD` before that tail can execute.
- `$1E:$BAD0-$BAD6`: the unmodified chapter-three state-9 snapshot supplies Taloon's eight sprite frames, and a
  ROM-backed simulation of the exact twelve-iteration feedback loop at `$BA41-$BACD` consumes every index
  `$08-$0E` through `$BAC8,Y`.
