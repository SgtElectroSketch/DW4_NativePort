The instruction, content-range, and overlap figures are classification components, not independent progress
targets. Their union is complete: 163,493 instruction bytes + 361,313 content-range bytes - 518 bytes present in
both inventories = 524,288 classified PRG bytes.

All-bank entry-point pass: 2,141 pointer entries across declared tables, mixed records, text/UI escape handlers,
and explicit pointer fields. All 2,036 executable targets decode; RTS-dispatch tables are registered with their
value+1 targets. All 38 decoded indirect jumps have reviewed dispositions. Correcting the two RTS-biased
subtables at `$16:$A73B/$A777` removed a false operand entry, and progression-state tracing recovered the
handler at `$16:$AAEF` from a stale variable-record boundary.

The completion gate (`verify-completion.cmd`) passes end to end: 0 current analyzer warnings; 215 warning
identities ledgered, including all 143 original warnings; 2,141 pointers typed; 2,036/2,036 executable targets
decoded; 38/38 indirect jumps audited; 4,562 routine interfaces; 4,562 semantic contracts; 26 asset slices; 17 save
fields; 9 runtime paths; exact ROM match.

The 2026-09-28 routine-name audit checked all 2,354 interfaces in banks `$00-$15` against their generated ASM
bodies and interface evidence. A follow-up control-flow pass added absolute JMP trampolines and bounded tail-call
targets, increasing the all-bank inventory from 4,315 to 4,562 routines. Confirmed semantic errors, operand-derived
names, and generic subsystem prefixes were corrected. The audit now resolves direct `$D3` battle-message calls
against decoded text and flags generic selection, accumulator, marker, route, action, result, and state names on
their owning routines. It reports zero review flags; duplicate-address, duplicate-global-name, and byte-identical
fixed-bank semantic-name checks are also clean.

The follow-up audio audit decoded bank `$19` entries `$02-$09` as APU reset, track start, completion flags,
flagged track start, global audio setting, completion wait, map-track selection, and map-music playback. It also
corrected physical damage, victory rewards, monster stats, agility-based turn order, casino payouts, cursed-item
feedback, and map-event jingles. The naming report now warns on audio-only display/print/message labels and on
`Dormant` labels with direct or tail callers; both queues are empty.

The corrective field/story audit registered selector `$D3` as battle-message dispatch and `$04,$6F` as the direct
field-message service. Bank `$12:$9300-$B5FF` now distinguishes item use, field spells, Adventure Log handling,
level growth and spell learning, the Lighthouse fire scene, and neutral transition/operation helpers whose owning
subsystem is not proven. Banks `$1C-$1E` identify their evidenced story scenes; chapter labels consistently use
displayed values 1-5. All 100 changed lower-fixed names were compared with their prior semantics; stronger Select,
field-frame, Start-menu, entity visibility, map-object animation, and Coin Seller names were restored in both twins.

The fifth corrective naming pass renamed core battle routines for their main path rather than an early failure
branch; standardized `$7361-$7362` and its consumers as the active battle damage amount; and curated the battle
command menu while leaving action `$41/$43` identities explicitly unverified. Sparse generated-label overrides now
assign evidenced subsystem prefixes to address ranges before falling back to each bank's dominant classification,
correcting 335 bank `$12` and 293 bank `$17` generated definitions. Seven fly-away routines and roughly 40 field,
service, and story routines now use decoded behavior. The naming review also flags failure-framed names that print
direct battle text; the resulting review queue remains empty.

The 2026-09-29 sixth audit covered all 4,905 curated labels and manually reviewed all 4,577 Function/Code bodies.
All 126 findings (37 High, 46 Medium, 43 Low) are retained in `../analysis/audits/audit6-ledger.tsv`. Corrections
include battle-AI scoring in bank `$13`, monster display and ordered Necrosaro form transitions in bank `$14`,
shop/dialogue event scripts in bank `$15`, the field-command and found-item flows in bank `$1E`, scripted battles
and party joins, fixed-bank encounter/world-trigger semantics, and the retail-unreachable chapter-selection path.
The pass also separates CharacterRecord, BattlePartyRecord, and CombatantRecord vocabulary and corrects music,
palette, handler-table, and debug-feature data classifications. `../scripts/check_audit6_labels.py` verifies the
ledger totals and rejects stale audit names, duplicate labels, missing key mappings, and routine-contract drift.

The 2026-09-29 follow-up sweep resolved 14 residual findings (1 High, 4 Medium, 9 Low). It moved the Clay Doll
battle name to the actual `$1D:$9C52` entry, corrected character-record bit set/clear direction and the capped-add
path at `$10:$865B`, replaced unsupported tactics terminology with packed-record-field selectors, and named the
party inventory search. Canonical map identities now qualify all 82 bank `$1C` and seven bank `$1D` map-specific
handlers. The remaining corrections cover treasure/search routines, casino display restoration, the Iron Safe
return, boss-ID notes, shared RAM `$75BB`, named trampoline calls, and residual bank `$14` display terminology.

The next verification sweep found eight regressions introduced by that pass. Four adjacent bank `$1C` handlers
are now aligned with their actual Lighthouse, Kievs, Cave of Betrayal, and Keeleon table entries; Haville uses
submap one. Bank `$1E` now distinguishes the Cave of Betrayal movement effect, map-transition party helpers,
unused DOOR helper, map-exit SEARCH message, and general map/field directory. Bank `$13:$91A9` correctly records
eighteen action IDs versus seventeen real handlers, leaving action ID `$60` without a handler entry.

The final one-issue audit correction identifies `$1E:$9E7A` as `FindHeroPartyOrdinalOrFallback`, called only by
chapter startup, and limits `$1E:$8FA5` to its verified scene-transition caller.

The contract-completion pass now covers all 4,562 verified routine interfaces. It preserves 32 specialized,
hand-authored contracts and derives 4,530 evidence-bounded contracts from the reviewed all-body label notes plus
conservative decoded register, memory-write, call, and entry evidence. `../scripts/sync_routine_contracts.py`
reproduces the inventory; extraction rejects missing, stale, duplicate, or label-mismatched contracts.

The 2026-09-28 naming pass completed banks `$16-$1F`. Every bank now has zero generated routine-entry names in
both generated assembly and the routine-interface inventory.

## Routine Naming Completion

`Named` counts curated code/function/interrupt/vector labels that coincide with an entry in
`analysis/routine-interfaces.tsv`. `Remaining %` uses each bank's routine count as its denominator. Pure-data banks
have no routine interfaces and report `n/a`.

## Enforced Evidence Checks

`Dw4Tool extract` fails unless every check below holds:

- Inline-operand ABI (`config/inline-operand-abi.tsv`): BRK operand counts come from the dispatcher and handler
  code, with each rule citing its handler. No inline operand byte may be a runtime-executed instruction start.
  Stack-correlated tracing proves the declared continuation for 688 call sites; 34 older sites remain explicitly
  labeled `legacy-address-only`, not causal resume evidence. Any conflicting causal continuation fails extraction.
- Progression-state tracing stages archived `.sav`/`.fcN` files only under `work/fceux`; the 31-snapshot corpus
  covers all chapters and four final-battle forms. `analysis/fceux-read-sources.tsv` attributes each ROM read to
  its executing bank/PC, while `analysis/fceux-observations.tsv` records selected register and RAM domains.
- Runtime evidence admits only unmodified state execution. A forced record-selection experiment entered excluded
  bank `$00` dialogue data; its observations were rejected and removed before rebuilding the normal state corpus.
- BRK services `$2A,$0F` and `$2B,$0F` now resolve to bank `$10:$A240/$A256`: they select a random set-bit index
  from the low nibble or full byte, return carry clear for an empty mask, and have reviewed routine contracts.
- Evidence priority: imported Ghidra blocks are supplementary. Blocks that start inside established code, raise
  any analyzer warning, or overlap a verified content range are rejected and listed in `analysis/code-report.txt`.
- A BRK that selects a bank without a verified `$8000` service directory, or a JSR/JMP into `$0800-$5FFF`, stops
  its path as invalid code.
- `config/code-data-overlaps.tsv` must exactly equal the final code/content intersection. This preserves the 522
  reviewed dual-use bytes while rejecting any undeclared overlap, regardless of seed source.
- Warning ledger (`config/analyzer-warning-ledger.tsv`): current warnings must match exactly, and each resolved
  warning's disposition is re-checked. `config/analyzer-warning-manifest.tsv` protects the full ledger and original
  inventory, including reason text and post-original identities, against unreviewed edits or deletion.
- Evidence citations: every `MNEMONIC operand at $ADDR` cited by a content-range or entry-table reason must be
  decoded code at that address.
- Index bounds (`config/index-bounds.tsv`): 169 rows each cap one decoded absolute-indexed consumer to a cited
  index range. Extraction rejects a bound that any source-attributed runtime read or recorded index-register
  observation contradicts, and every byte a bound can reach must be typed.
- `ReviewedUnusedData` ranges are analyzed without data suppression and fail extraction if they contain decoded
  code or inline operands, overlap a code exclusion, receive a declared pointer or a static absolute/indexed
  reference, execute, or receive a source-attributed runtime read. An indexed reference counts across base through
  base+255 unless an index bound caps it. Fifty-three ranges currently satisfy this policy.
- The 127 guarded flow-recovery seeds are revalidated against a baseline decode.

The orphan audit discovered the indirect parser for `$12:$A2B6-$A303` through chapter pointers at `$916E` and
runtime reads from `$8FC9/$8FD5`. Banks `$0E:$BAD7-$BAF6`, `$13:$94EC-$951A`, and `$1D:$916F-$918D` now use the
reviewed-unused policy. Bank `$08:$8ABB-$8ADA` is now typed through its `$80C2/$80C3` pointer consumer, while
`$08:$8AA2-$8AAE` stays open because `$8AA2,Y` has no proven ceiling; this is intentionally not overridden by
negative runtime evidence.

Bank `$14` is now fully classified. The final proofs include four action-presentation records selected only by
bank `$11` action IDs `$69-$6C`, sixteen motion offsets bounded by the preceding sprite movement, phase tables
bounded through both callers of `$8D7A`, special-ID tables guarded below nine, and two eleven-entry selector rows
whose ten callers set `$0F` to zero through ten. Bank `$16` is now fully classified. Its title-menu tables are proven
from the `$B78C` slot-mask builder and UI records `$53-$55`, and scripted COPY/ERASE walks exercised all eight
slot masks. Its text-input and dialogue-row tables are proven from the only records that select them.

Corrections made in the 2026-09-27 pass:

- Three reviewed-unused claims were wrong and are now typed: `$13:$94EC-$951A`, `$10:$95EF-$9600`, and
  `$1D:$B285-$B287`.
- `$16:$B71F` was wrong as reviewed-unused. It is the last byte of the keyboard list, now `$B699-$B71F`.
- Six reviewed-unused claims were withdrawn for lacking index bounds. Five are now resolved with proofs:
  `$12:$914C-$914F` and `$12:$91D1-$91D7` are reviewed-unused under a chapter bound, `$16:$A4D6-$A4DD` is
  reviewed-unused, `$1F:$ED49-$ED4A` is the 99th audio period entry, and `$16:$BC41-$BC42` is read data (see
  the next item). At that checkpoint `$0F/$1F:$DFF0` remained open; the final classification pass below resolves it.
- `$16:$BC35` claimed six status pairs because `$10:$9613` "returns zero through six", and the `$16:$BC29/$BC2F`
  bounds used that claim. `$9613` returns zero through seven: field five (poison) gives seven. The table has seven
  pairs, `$BC35-$BC42`, and both bounds are now `$00-$0C`. Runtime never contradicted the old bound because no
  trace displayed a poisoned member there.
- The `$16:$A4CE` evidence attributed Y at `$8E75/$8E88` to `AND #$07` at `$8E53`. That instruction only compares
  against Y; the caller at `$8CEF-$8CF9` masks and counts Y.
- The names `$16:$B755` and `$16:$B785` were wrong. They are title-menu and adventure-log row counts, not party
  data.

## Completion Definition

Semantic assembly is done only when all of these conditions hold:

- Zero unclassified byte ranges. **Done.**
- Zero generated routine-entry names. **Done.**
- Complete reviewed routine contracts. **Done.**
- Structured lossless encoders for all five asset classes. **Open: 0/5.**
- Fully proven save/load and validation behavior. **Open beyond the currently observed direct-SRAM paths.**
- Deterministic end-to-end runtime scenarios for all nine domains. **Open; current trace assertions pass but are
  evidence checks rather than complete scenarios.**
- Continued exact-ROM reproduction. **Mandatory gate; currently passing.**

## Remaining Work

1. Build structured lossless decoders and encoders for text, maps, graphics, palettes, and audio.
2. Define engine-neutral game-state and content schemas from the completed assembly and asset models.
3. Implement a headless deterministic simulation and compare combat, movement, events, RNG, and save/load behavior
   against emulator traces.
4. Turn the nine passing runtime-evidence domains into deterministic end-to-end scenarios.
5. Build one vertical slice in the chosen engine, then add editing tools and intentional gameplay changes.

Entry-point recovery, byte classification, warning disposition, routine naming, routine contracts, and the exact-ROM
gate are maintenance checks now; rerun them whenever new evidence changes code or data boundaries.

## Control-Flow Conflicts

There are no current conflicts. The three overlaps once audited as intentional were all decoding artifacts:

- Bank `$10:$BBEB`: a phantom `EOR #$A5` from reading the three-operand BRK at `$BBE7` as two-operand.
- Bank `$16:$B84A`: entered by `BPL $B84A` decoded from RTS-dispatch value `$B89F`; the handler begins at `$B8A0`.
- Bank `$1F:$CE50`: `CPY #$AA` came from a Ghidra block starting inside `JSR $CEA9`. The fixed-bank BRK
  continuation decodes `JSR $CEA9; JMP $C010`.

Each is recorded as resolved in `config/analyzer-warning-ledger.tsv`.
